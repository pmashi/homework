16. \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item How many different outcomes are possible when 
    a pair of dice, one red and one white, 
    are rolled two successive times? 
    \begin{solution}
        Let $R = W = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$ where $R$ is the set 
        outcomes of rolling the red die and $W$ is of the white die.\\
        Possible outcomes in one roll can be expressed as $R \times W$, 
        and if we take the cardinality, $O=|R\times W| = |R| \times |W|
        =6*6=36$, which is the number of possble outcomes in one roll.\\
        The number of outcomes in two successive rolls will be 
        $O\times O$, and the number of possible outcomes in two rolls 
        is $|O\times O|=36*36 = 1296$. 
    \end{solution}
    \item What is the probability that each die shows the 
    same value on the second roll as on the first roll? 
    \begin{solution}
        
    \end{solution}
    \item What is the probability that the sum of the 
    two dice is the same on both rolls?
